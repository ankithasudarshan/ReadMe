ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Ankitha, a PhD student in Computer Science at SUNY Buffalo, where I dive deep into Natural Language Processing (NLP), Conversational AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Right now, Iâ€™m focusing on responsible AI, specifically working on improving how ASR systems understand context.

Before starting my PhD, I spent about two years at KPMG US as an Associate in Data & Analytics. There, I worked with Clara, their advanced ERP system, and developed various NLP applications, including conversational bots and account mapping tools, in collaboration with the KPMG Europe team. I also explored NLP for social media and financial data, and even ventured into computer vision, where I contributed to image processing, anomaly detection, and video summarizationâ€”my work in this area led to a published patent.

Iâ€™m always excited about new challenges and opportunities to collaborate. If youâ€™re interested in brainstorming or working together on research projects, Iâ€™d love to connect!
